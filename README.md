# Pentominoes (Group 7)

> Group 7, Phase 1

## Purpose of the project

The central topic of Project 1-1 is to create a computer application with a user-friendly
interface for solving the three-dimensional knapsack problem.
Within the scope of this project, the main objective is the development and implemen-
tation of a computer program using Java. The program's core functionality involves pop-
ulating a predefined rectangular space with specific objects known as pentominoes. The
initial phase of the project aims to create efficient algorithms that can arrange a given set
of pentominoes to maximize space utilization.
